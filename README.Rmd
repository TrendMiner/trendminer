trendminer is an R client for accessing selected endpoints of the TrendMiner API available at  http://developer.trendminer.com/. TrendMiner is an industrial self-service analytics platform for analyzing, monitoring and predicting time-series based process and asset data.  

## Installation

``` {r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alex23lemm/trendminer")
```

## Usage

Please make sure to set the following environment variable in `.Renviron` after installing the package.

```
TM_base_url = https://address.of.your.trendminer.instance
```
Every API request using the `trendminer` package will fetch the base URL of your TrendMiner installation from `TM_base_url`. You can easily edit `.Renviron` using `usethis::edit_r_environ()`.

Below are some things you can do after finishing your setup.

```{r}
library(trendminer)

token <- tm_get_token()
token
```

## Authentication

All requests to the TrendMiner API require authentication using a valid Bearer access token that is sent as part of the request headers. 

Request tokens are obtained via OAuth2.0 using a resource owner password credentials flow. Any client which likes to interact with the API needs to collect the credentials from the user (username and password) and passes them together with its own client credentials (client ID and client secret) to the TrendMiner server using the `tm_get_token()` function. The server responds with an access token which the user needs to use for any subsequent API requests.

User and client credentials can be passed as arguments to `tm_get_token()` for quick testing in interactive mode. However, it is recommended to call `tm_get_token()` without arguments. In this case `tm_get_token()` will fetch the credentials from the environment variables below which you need to store in `.Renviron`. 

```
TM_usr = ADD_YOUR_USER
TM_pwd = ADD_YOUR_PASSWORD
TM_client_ID = ADD_CLIENT_ID
TM_client_secret = ADD_CLIENT_SECRET
```
