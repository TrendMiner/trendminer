trendminer is an R client for accessing selected endpoints of the TrendMiner API available at  http://developer.trendminer.com/. TrendMiner is an industrial self-service analytics platform for analyzing, monitoring and predicting time-series based process and asset data.  

## Installation

``` {r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alex23lemm/trendminer")
```

## Usage

Below are some things you can do after installing the package:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(trendminer)
library(dplyr)

token <- tm_get_token()

# Fetch all available tags
my_tags <- tm_get_tags(token)

my_tags %>% 
  select(name, data) %>%
  head
```


## Authentication

All requests to the TrendMiner API require authentication using a valid Bearer access token that is sent as part of the request headers. 

Request tokens are obtained via OAuth2.0 using a resource owner password credentials flow. Any client which likes to interact with the API needs to collect the credentials from the user (username and password) and passes them together with its own client credentials (client ID and client secret) to the TrendMiner server using the `tm_get_token()` function. The server responds with an access token which the user needs to use for any subsequent API requests.

User credentials, client credentials and the TrendMiner base URL can be passed as arguments to `tm_get_token()` for quick testing in interactive mode. However, it is recommended to call `tm_get_token()` without arguments. In this case `tm_get_token()` will fetch the credentials and the TrendMiner base URL from the environment variables below which you need to store in `.Renviron`. You can easily edit `.Renviron` using `usethis::edit_r_environ()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
TM_client_ID = YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE
TM_client_secret = YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
TM_usr = YOUR_USER_NAME_HERE
TM_pwd = YOUR_USER_PASSWORD_HERE
TM_base_url = YOUR_TM_BASE_URL_HERE
```
